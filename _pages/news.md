## Interview with EU Horizon  magazine
29 October 2019

The first step to modify Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), a clinical method to alleviate symptoms in Parkinson's disease is to try and uncover how it affects the brain activity by creating computer simulations. They are mimicking the therapy on models of different parts of the brain to see how their activity or functions change. ‘This is one of the very basic things that we have to do,’ said Dr Farokhniaee. ‘With the simulations, we can improve current methods of deep brain stimulation.’
