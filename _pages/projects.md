I work on different lines of research that can be categorized in two: modeling and data analysis. They, in turn, have different applications from basic understanding of the nervous system and underlying mechanisms, and on the other hand, biomedical applications and emerging therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.

### 1) Computational Modelling of thalamo-cortical microcircuits for human movement



### 2) Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease


### 3) single neurons and neuronal networks modeling

### 4) Sound/Music perception and computational modeling of the auditory system

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Create a new file called `/_posts/2019-2-13-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. That's all you need to do to publish your first blog post! This [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might come in handy while writing the posts.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the <kbd>Create new file</kbd> button in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Using Categories in Reverie

You can categorize your content based on `categories` in Reverie. For this, you just need to add `categories` in front matter like below:

For adding single category:

```md
categories: JavaScript
```

For adding multiple categories:

```md
categories: [PHP, Laravel]
```

The contegorized content can be shown over this URL: <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/categories/>

## RSS

The generated [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/feed>. You can see the example RSS feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/feed).

## Sitemap

The generated sitemap of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/sitemap>. You can see the example sitemap feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/sitemap).
