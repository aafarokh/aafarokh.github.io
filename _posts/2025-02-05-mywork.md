Unlocking the complexity and immense interconnectivity of the most complex system in the universe, our brain, is a major goal of my research. To this end, I utilize the established methods in computational neuroscience, mathematical physics, engineering and physics of complex systems to acquire an overall understanding of the brain's robust phenomena. Have a look at some of my main fields of research in the projects tab.
